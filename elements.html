										<h2 id="content">1. SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING IOT:</h2>
										<p>The Smart irrigation System has wide scope to automate the complete irrigation system. Here we are building a IoT based Irrigation System using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module and DHT11 Sensor. It will not only automatically irrigate the water based on the moisture level in the soil but also send the Data to ThingSpeak Server to keep track of the land condition. The System will consist a water pump which will be used to sprinkle water on the land depending upon the land environmental condition such as Moisture, Temperature and Humidity.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Components Required</h3>
												<p>1. NodeMCU ESP8266<br>
													2. Soil Moisture Sensor Module<br>
													3. Water Pump Module<br>
													4. Relay Module<br>
													5. DHT11<br>
													6. Connecting Wires</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Working</h3>
												<p>In the agriculture field, sensors are used like soil moisture. The information received from the sensors is sent to the Database folder through the Android device. In the control section, the system is activated using the application, this is finished using the ON/OFF buttons in the application. Also, this system is automatically activated when the soil moisture is low, the pump is switched ON based on the moisture content.</p>
											</div>
											<!-- Break -->
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Uses</h3>
												<p>This is achieved by using a smart platform of IoT and solenoid valves to control the flow of water based on the moisture of the soil and gives real time surveillance to the owners who stay far away from the farms. This project also allows surveillance on the personnel and their crops so as to not occur losses.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Future Scopes</h3>
												<p>Irrigation is a process of providing the desire amounts of water to the agricultural land. This process is very beneficial in minimizing runoffs or drought situations for the croup’s cultivation.

													Due to alarming changes in the climate, farmers cannot rely on natural rainwater.
													
													Irrigation is important to yield good quality crops in the seasonable or non-seasonable period.</p>

										<h2 id="content">2. SMART AGRICULTURE CONTROLLING AND MONITORING SYSTEM USING IOT:</h2>
										<p>The agricultural development is accelerated
											with the increase in the productivity and
											upgradation of the plantation systems. The
											Internet of Things (IoT) has the capability
											to transform the world. However, the
											application of technology like IoT in
											agriculture could have the greatest impact. </p>
